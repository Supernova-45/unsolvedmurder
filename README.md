There's a murder in the Advanced Topics in CS class? *gasp*

## Usage

It's a text based game.  Type in commands that you have such as /scenedescription or /suspects.  If the command does not exist, nothing will 
happen.  However, if you come across commands hidden within the game and type them, something will happen that will give you clues.
In order to play the game, investigate parts of the room, discover clues, play games, and find hidden easter eggs.
The point of the game is to maybe solve a murder?  Maybe?  How do you win?  You don't.
